Yahtzee is a classic dice game played with five dice, known for its blend of luck and strategy. The game is published by Hasbro and was originally developed by a Canadian couple in the early 20th century.

Objective & Basic Gameplay
Objective: Score the most points by rolling certain dice combinations across a series of turns.
Number of Dice: 5 standard six-sided dice (values 1 through 6).
Number of Rounds: The game consists of thirteen rounds.
Turns per Round: On each turn, a player may roll the dice up to three times:
First Roll: Roll all five dice.
Second Roll (optional): Choose which dice to keep and re-roll the rest.
Third Roll (optional): Again, choose which dice to keep and re-roll the others.
After a maximum of three rolls per round, the player must assign their dice to an available category on their scorecard.

Scorecard & Categories
There are thirteen categories—one for each round. Once a category is used, it cannot be used again. The categories are divided into two sections:

Upper Section (Ones through Sixes):

Ones: Score the sum of dice that show a 1.
Twos: Score the sum of dice that show a 2.
Threes: Score the sum of dice that show a 3.
Fours: Score the sum of dice that show a 4.
Fives: Score the sum of dice that show a 5.
Sixes: Score the sum of dice that show a 6.
Bonus: If the total of these six categories (1-6) is 63 or more, the player earns a 35-point bonus.

Lower Section (Combination-based):

Three of a Kind: If at least three dice show the same number, score the sum of all five dice.
Four of a Kind: If at least four dice show the same number, score the sum of all five dice.
Full House: If the dice show three of one number and two of another, score 25 points.
Small Straight: If the dice form a sequence of four consecutive values (e.g., 1-2-3-4, 2-3-4-5, or 3-4-5-6), score 30 points.
Large Straight: If the dice form a sequence of five consecutive values (e.g., 1-2-3-4-5 or 2-3-4-5-6), score 40 points.
Yahtzee: If all five dice show the same value (e.g., 2-2-2-2-2), score 50 points.
Chance: Score the sum of all five dice, regardless of what they show.
Important: A Yahtzee (all five dice the same) is one of the most prized rolls because it awards 50 points. Some rulesets also provide extra Yahtzee bonuses if you roll more than one Yahtzee in the same game, but that is an optional variation.

Ending the Game & Winning:
After all thirteen rounds, each category on the scorecard will be filled exactly once. The player (or team) with the highest total score wins. Ties are broken by comparing each tied player’s final total once more, or by deciding on additional tiebreaker criteria (house rules may apply).

Strategy & Common Questions:
When to keep certain dice? Deciding which dice to hold and which to re-roll can make or break your score. For example, if you’re aiming for a Large Straight, you might keep a run of three consecutive numbers and re-roll the rest.
Difference between Three of a Kind and Four of a Kind: Both categories score the sum of all five dice, but you need at least three matching dice for Three of a Kind, and at least four matching dice for Four of a Kind.
Scoring in Chance: Use Chance when your dice don’t fit other categories, or to maximize your total if you roll high numbers across all five dice without forming a combination like Three of a Kind.
Upper Section Bonus: A key part of strategy is aiming to get at least 63 points across Ones-Sixes to secure the 35-point bonus. 63 points typically equates to scoring an average of three marks per die face (for example, three 1s in the Ones category, three 2s in Twos, etc.).
Full House Clarification: A Full House specifically requires 3 of one number + 2 of another. Example: 3-3-3 and 5-5. This always scores 25 points, no matter which numbers form the Full House.
Yahtzee: Rolling all five dice the same value (e.g., 6-6-6-6-6). This is rare but scores 50 points. Some house rules let you score an additional bonus (100 points) if you roll more than one Yahtzee in the same game.
Number of Rerolls: You can roll up to three times each turn, but you don’t have to use all three if you’re satisfied with your combination.
Game Length: There are exactly thirteen rounds in a standard Yahtzee game—one for each category on the scorecard. After that, the game ends and you tally your final score.
